## Architecture Overview

The Parlay Golf Ventures platform is built as a modern React application with TypeScript integration. The architecture follows a well-organized structure with clear separation of concerns:

### Frontend Architecture

- **React Router**: Handles client-side routing with protected routes for authenticated content
- **Component Hierarchy**: Organized into public, member, admin, and shared components
- **Context API**: Used for global state management (Auth, Loading)
- **API Layer**: Centralized API utilities for backend communication
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries and monitoring

### Backend Integration

- **Supabase**: Primary backend service for authentication and data storage
- **Mock Data**: Development environment uses mock data to avoid database dependencies
- **API Abstraction**: Clean separation between frontend and backend through API utilities

### Development Environment

- **Vite**: Modern build tool for fast development experience
- **TypeScript**: Gradual migration from JavaScript to TypeScript
- **ESLint**: Code quality enforcement with custom rules
- **Environment Configuration**: Centralized configuration for development vs. production

## Component Analysis

### Core Components

1. **Authentication System**
   - Well-implemented AuthContext with proper role management
   - Development bypass options for testing
   - Comprehensive error handling for auth operations

2. **Loading System**
   - Standardized loading state management through hooks
   - Component-level and global loading indicators
   - Consistent loading UI patterns across the application

3. **Error Handling**
   - Error boundaries at multiple levels
   - Consistent error UI components
   - Error monitoring integration

4. **Navigation**

2. **TypeScript Implementation**:
   - Incomplete TypeScript migration with some components still using `any` types
   - Recent fixes to Dashboard component TypeScript errors

3. **Component Documentation**:
   - Inconsistent documentation across components
   - Some components lack proper JSDoc comments
